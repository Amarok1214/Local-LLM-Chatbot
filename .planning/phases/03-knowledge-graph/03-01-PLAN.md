# 03-knowledge-graph: Build Simple Knowledge Graph

**Phase**: 03-knowledge-graph
**Goal**: Create a simple knowledge graph with general topics and query function

## Context

@.planning/BRIEF.md - Project requirements
@.planning/ROADMAP.md - Phase overview
@.planning/phases/02-llm-server/02-01-PLAN.md - LLM server running

## Tasks

### Task 1: Create knowledge graph module
- [ ] Create `knowledge_graph.py`
- [ ] Use networkx for in-memory graph
- [ ] Define nodes with topic information
- [ ] Define edges connecting related topics

### Task 2: Populate with general topics
- [ ] Add nodes for general topics (science, history, technology, etc.)
- [ ] Add edges representing relationships
- [ ] Include basic facts/definitions in node attributes

### Task 3: Implement query function
- [ ] Create function to find relevant nodes based on query
- [ ] Use keyword matching or simple similarity
- [ ] Return context: list of related facts

### Task 4: Create graph data structure
```python
# Example structure
graph = {
    "nodes": [
        {"id": "python", "type": "technology", "fact": "Python is a programming language"},
        {"id": "machine_learning", "type": "technology", "fact": "Machine learning is AI subset"},
    ],
    "edges": [
        {"source": "python", "target": "machine_learning", "relation": "used_in"},
    ]
}
```

## Verification

- [ ] `knowledge_graph.py` imports networkx
- [ ] Graph has at least 10 nodes (general topics)
- [ ] Graph has edges connecting related topics
- [ ] Query function returns relevant context

## Notes

- Simple approach: keyword matching for queries
- Can expand later with embeddings if needed
- Mirror prism's query-first approach: query graph → get context → send to LLM
